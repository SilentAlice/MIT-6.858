[zookd.c:70]
    if ((errmsg = http_request_line(fd, reqpath, env, &env_len)))

	buffer of reqpath is 2048, we can send a long URI to attack it


[http.c:129]
	if (http_read_line(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) < 0)

	buffer of buf is 8192, but it must store all headers. 
	So we can exploit by sending a long header.


[http.c:159]
	url_decode(value, sp);
	
	because the buffer of value is 512, so we can attack it by sending a long header.


[http.c:165]
	sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf);

	The size of envvar is 512, so we can add a long string start with HTTP_ in 
	header, and springf will write it to buffer envvar. Stack of function 
	"const char *http_request_headers(int fd)" will be smashed.


[zookfs.c:47]
	http_serve(sockfd, getenv("REQUEST_URI"));
[http.c:282]
	Function: http_serve:    strcat(pn, name);
	
	Buffer of pn is 1024, but name can be passed via getenv("REQUEST_URI");
	So, we can send a long request URI, and in http.c, this concatenation
	will smash the stack of http_serve
